# Hong Kong Majong!
All the crappy majong apps were not very user friendly, were 2d, or didnt have animations. SO I did something about it. Im planning to post it on the play store eventually. I'm quite mew to C sharp so this was a good learning oppertuninty. I did use a bit of AI, but calude and gemini and chatgpt were not too good with the logic stuff, only the minor syntax I did'nt know well.
